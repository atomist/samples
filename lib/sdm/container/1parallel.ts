/**
 * Atomist SDM Sample
 * @description SDM that uses containers to build projects against multiple versions of Node.
 * @tag sdm,container,node
 * @instructions <p>This SDM is now listening for pushes to repos with
 *               "package.json" files.  Push some new commits to one
 *               such repo and this SDM will checkout the code, install
 *               dependencies and run tests against multiple versions of
 *               Node.js in parallel.  Make sure your Docker CLI is
 *               configured properly.</p>
