/**
 * Atomist SDM Sample
 * @description SDM that uses containers to build projects against multiple versions of Node and Maven.
 * @tag sdm,container,node,maven
 * @instructions <p>This SDM is now listening for pushes to repos with
 *               "package.json" and "pom.xml" files.  Push some new commits
 *               to one such repo and this SDM will checkout the code, install
 *               dependencies and run tests against multiple versions of the
 *               appropriate runtime in parallel.  Make sure your Docker CLI
 *               is configured properly.</p>
