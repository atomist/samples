/**
 * Atomist SDM Sample
 * @description SDM that uses containers to build Node.js project and their Docker images.
 * @tag sdm,container,node,docker,kaniko
 * @instructions <p>This SDM is now listening for pushes to repos with
 *               "package.json" files.  Push some new commits to one
 *               such repo and this SDM will checkout the code, install
 *               dependencies, run tests, and build a Docker image.
 *               Make sure your Docker CLI is configured properly.</p>
