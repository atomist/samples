/**
 * Atomist SDM Sample
 * @description Demonstrates how to create a goal that has a project listener
 * @tag listener
 * @instructions <p>Now that the SDM is up and running, make a commit to a repository
 *               that has:
 *               <ul>
 *                   <li>an Atomist webhook configured</li>
 *                   <li>is a NodeJS project with Typescript files</li>
 *                   <li>has a script called "compile" that calls <code>tsc<code></li>
 *               </ul>
 *               You can observe the goal from chat or https://app.atomist.com.</p>
